# Intra-annual variation in marine species distributions
Public code repository to support Andrew J. Allyn and Bart DiFiore, Carly S. Lovas, Nathan T. Hermann, Nathan B. Furey, Katherine E. Mills. *Diverse intra-annual distribution shifts among marine fish feeding guilds:  Planktivore convergence in a warming ecosystem.* Projected submission Spring 2026.

#### Overview
In this repository, you will find a number of R scripts and data files to recreate the analyses and figures included in our forthcoming publication. Many of these analyses are built using the [Northeast Fisheries Science Center Spring-Fall Bottom Trawl Survey](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/inport/item/22557) and it's derived metrics, which will be housed on [BCO-DMO](https://www.bco-dmo.org/project/834426). Access to the BCO-DMO files will allow for replication of these analyses without the need for a direct data request from NEFSC. Consequently, code to process and clean the trawl survey has been omitted. If access to this analysis is necessary, please contact kmills@gmri.org.

#### Data
Data used in the replication of these analyses can be found on BCO-DMO. Two files `seasonal_distance.csv` and `trawl_yearday_difference.csv` are housed on BCO-DMO and will be needed to run subsequent analyses. The files can either be downloaded locally or read in remotely into R.

#### Scripts
Here you will find the following scripts, to be run in order, to recreate the supporting analyses.
